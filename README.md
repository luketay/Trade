Trading
==============================

The puprose of this project is to view how the non-stationarity of data impacts the ability for a model to generalise.
We explore using a fractional geometric brownian motion to account for the constantly changing data generating functions of financial assests.
The hypothesis is that rather then treating a historical dataset, of size T, as a time series data set with T data points, we are treating this as only 1 data point. So, if a historical data set is only 1 data point, it makes sense that the algorithm will not generalise. The solution is to tune the hyperparameters of the fractional geometric brownian motion to generate data sets similar to the historical data set that we have, and then generate N realisations of length T.
